<p>Thought I had been coping but I took a hit of acid one month in and found my heart is pretty broken. I'd stayed afloat wth rage and internet code and whiskey but after 30 days I can feel my gut swelling and the electric thumping wired into my skull isn't giving the same kick. Basically drinking in a panic now, the enevitable slide of my whole morning into this desparate pit, a wet sucking on the back of my face creating thick distance between myself and the perceived world.</p>
<p>The alcohol is making me feel better.</p>
<p>Turns out most of my friends were her friends. I have neighbors and bartenders and coworkers. I drink alone next to my pull up bar and wonder what the fuck comes next.</p>
<p>Answer: IPA with breakfast and he could probably smell it on me when I hugged him hello, cooked me kimchi eggs and reflected on his recent moves toward a Doaist flavor of Christianity. He'd met my ex's landlord and thought he was a great guy.</p>
<p>His roommates filtered in and out with plates of sliced fruit and I marvelled at their ability to live motivated lives without a bunch fo drugs to keep them afloat.</p>
<p>Calling bullshit on the Buddha and frying up another round of eggs, it's getting darker early now and his ktichen is mostly in shadow while she boils french press and asks: "You know when you're in love?"</p>
<p>I nod once.</p>
<p>She's off to the city for oysters and margaritas. I will mix the weird dregs of my home bar and tightrope between drinking off psychic agony and still being able to write code in the morning.</p>
<p>Wring out my prefontal cortex on my desk and throw my brainstem down on the bar. I bum cigarettes and beers of my neighbors in the parking lot then go upstairs to cry the names of various godesses/elephants at HVAC systems.</p>
<p>It didn't occur to me until taking a hit over my 2nd drink later at home that night that maybe all this is just comedown from the acid trip yesterday- maybe I'm not as hopeless as I feel.</p>
<p>Stringing my thoughts along and along, watching them stretch and drone like a suffocating infomercial, the light on my walls sinks from hue to hue and I keep boring tunnels of this neural garbage at the brick. Oatmeal and gin for dinner, pray the morning bike ride will sweat me straight enough to work again.</p>
<p>People usually don't say anything when I tell them I'm coping with the breakup by drinking. I am giving into the depressive intertia of this afternoon, I am letting it pull me down to the floor where I will lie still waiting for the dark. I will not make feeble delusions of resistance by doing the laundry or wiping fuzzy unbrushed porcelain teeth in my bathroom, I will drink and smoke and lie down until it is dark. I will wake up with a throbbing head and ride into the gravel spill garbage morning and wonder who could possibly convince me to stop doing this to myself, this bone marrow weight constantly whispering a dream to drink and smoke and die.</p>
<p>The slow stagnant dusty shade of an apartment rarely inhabited, fragments of our former love still pinned or thrown at walls and corners.</p>
<p>I have this beautiful photo of her and I have to keep remebering the pain. How even though we're both still here I had to go. I was clinging to a picture: the woman was gone and had become someone I could no longer walk with without screaming.</p>
