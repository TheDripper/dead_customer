<p>Spent about a week checking if I was gay but turns out I'm not. I kissed and held hands with a couple different boys but it didn't feel much different than hanging out with my friends. This made all the more obvious as soon as a woman walks into the room and in reflex I start saying stupid shit to get her attention, sneaking glances and making my psychotic/sex face at empty bottles of IPA and burrito scraps to appear deep and full of beautiful angst.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she hovers like Lakshmi or Eve or Barbie in my drunk tossing weed ripping insomnia hours, melting my sight into the ductwork against the shriek of state government highway contracts and debris yard easement trucks backing up, backing up, backing up, apparently in an endless circle: all night, all night.</p>
