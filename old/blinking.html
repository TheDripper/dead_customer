<p>I am in a shady summer living room with curtains blocking the glare for a very large LCD television screen on the couch next to the first girl in high school to express sexual affection for me. it was the early 2000s, so you could get on cable most hours and watch documentary footage of people smoking meth out of aluminum foil in their cars.</p>
<p>This is what we are doing and perhaps the romantically tone deaf subject matter is why she inevitably goes for the water polo player and leaves me dropping out of band to eat cinnamon pita chips out behind the tennis club. Our romance remains an open question until she is hit by a freight train during her senior year at a liberal arts college in the midwest.</p>
<p>straight outta therapy and into the bar; I was so lonely at work today I wanted to cry. Trying to squeeze some emotions out of my constapated blood vessels while drowning in flourescent monitor glow, catching her eyes for a second every few hours; these ecstatic sparks of lust punctuating the endless drone of error messages and logs silently posting data into the ether around my head while I actively look at everything but her.</p>
<p>She passes my desk and whispers my name right when I'm first starting to think about killing myself again.</p>
<p>We're all here just blinking at each other and I'm leaving with my clothes on, back to the BART where big sweaty men in high-vis gear will spit and drool at me like I'm a quarter pounder w/ cheese.</p>
<p>I am getting high in the shade with my sweater on and trying to clear my head of agnoizing visions of her next to cases of LaCroix. I was downwind of her moisturerizer with a face like I'd gone incognito. She was blinking at me and talking about old movies. Somehow nobody else was in the lunchroom except the lady wiping down the counters who kept bouncing nervous glances off me like I was a school shooter.</p>
<p>I stumble out into the hissing sunshine from behind the overpass to retreat into a repurposed rubber factory and drink Hazy IPA/Vida Mezcal while surrounded by televisions displaying slow motion footage of cheesesteak/athletes. I am waiting on emails from Github or my mom. I wonder if my anxiety disorder is related to how she spent the pregnancy watching the first gulf war on CNN.</p>
