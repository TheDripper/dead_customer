<p>Everyone in the cafe flanked on all sides by papers and wires and screens and looking pissed or lobotomized. Someone has clogged the shitter with paper towels.</p>
<p>Blurry from benzo coma and starting to blink awake out of secondhand swisher sweet fog into the perpetual towering of money and a cascading series of repeating tasks.</p>
<p>A meticulous mapping of empty rooms.</p>
<p>Reverberations dreamt in unison by the dead.</p>
<p>Cardiac motion pushing circles of blind fluid between bones and freeways in our perpetual buffer. i am desperate for the way seasons carry blurry fragments of former selves in the texture of their air like constellations of hormones suspended in the smells.</p>
<p>Today my work has been hijacked by an intense wave of nostalgia for virtual places that don't actually exist anywhere except in electronic suspension between pre-trade-war graphics chips probably now writhing sun bleached at the landfill. But still I can remember these places as if I were acutally there, even though really I was slumped in my brother's oversized t-shirts sitting in the same guest bedroom as bright red sony digits silently signaled the glittery passing of the 90s.</p>
