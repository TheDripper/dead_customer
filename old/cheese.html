<p>straight outta therapy and into the bar; I was so lonely at work today I wanted to cry. Trying to squeeze some emotions out of my constapated blood vessels while drowning in flourescent monitor glow, catching her eyes for a second every few hours; these ecstatic sparks of lust punctuating the endless drone of error messages and logs silently posting data into the ether around my head while I actively look at everything but her.</p>

<p>I know I'm always pulling on my belt but what I really need right now is some understanding, not just another hot wet body. She whispers my name when she passes my desk right when I'm first starting to think about killing myself again.</p>

<p>A tremendous visceral relief followed by swallowing horror at realizing that's it for today, maybe the week: we're all here just blinking at each other and I'm leaving with my clothes on, back to the BART where big sweaty men in high-vis gear will spit and drool at me like I'm a quarter pounder w/ cheese.</p>
