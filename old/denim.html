<div id=text>
<p>Trying to hand wash my denim in the bathub with fragrance free and find out at work the next morning that it doesn't work. Lyft driver was icy getting home cause I was stinking up his car with cigarettes which is totally fair.</p>
<p>Float in high on nasal decongestant and cold brew, trying to impress her with my posture and facial expressions even though she'd just come home to another drunk pothead spouting dharma at nobody.</p>
<p>I grip my adjustable standing desk with both hands and struggle not to punch myself in the face as a flock of executive laughter strolls by: this is not on brand.</p>
<p>I make for the door, making things worse by fishing for a flicker of eye contact as she turns to enter the QA lab.</p>
<p>I craft elaborate lines of digital text to score enough to get fucked up in a room full of strangers under an endlessly repeating sporting event. I have air conditioning and locks on my door and youtube videos and vegan canned soup. The camps along the railline catch fire once or twice a month.</p> 
<p>Staring at my drink, starting to make myself cry by thinking too hard about John Mayer. Out with mononucleosis 1.5 quarters into Week 1 of the 2019 season.</p>
<p>I think about it at night when the booze and weed wear off and I can't sleep</p>
<p>and then I think about it smoking in the morning above the debris yard outside my window while the shower warms up.</p>
<p>Gasps and squirts and puffs of smoke. My head itches and my fingers smell like burned paper.</p>
