<p>Float in high on nasal decongestant and cold brew, trying to impress her with my posture and facial expressions even though she'd just come home to another drunk pothead spouting dharma at nobody.</p>
<p>Staring at my drink, starting to make myself cry by thinking too hard about John Mayer. Out with mononucleosis 1.5 quarters into Week 1 of the 2019 season.</p>
<p>Spent about a week checking if I was gay but turns out I'm not. I kissed and held hands with a couple different boys but it didn't feel much different than hanging out with my friends. This made all the more obvious as soon as a woman walks into the room and in spinal/sacral refex I start saying stupid shit to get her attention, sneaking glances and making my psychotic/sex face at empty bottles of IPA and burrito scraps.</p>
<p>Getting whiplash from trying to look at anything but her face. I see it and end up sweating myself into a stink and writhing muttered fucks in the white noise of my therapists waiting room.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she hovers like Lakshmi or Eve or Barbie in my drunk tossing weed ripping insomnia hours, melting my sight into the ductwork against the shriek of state government highway contracts and hardscaping easement trucks backing up, backing up, backing up, apparently in an endless circle: all night, all night.</p>
