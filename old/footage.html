<p>We talk about talking and also peanuts over peanuts and tea- I am thinking of how this noodle house has become a church for me, I come here hungover to repent before the silver-haired owner who brings us stir-fry and news of The Fed injecting 90 million $USD into the economy implying immenent collapse.</p>
<p>The smell of black volvo leather and subtle fragrance on the way back, I am blinded by the noontime Bay.</p>
<p>Taking meetings and lunches all day until by the time I actually sit down to write code I'm so burnt off caffiene and social anxiety that I can't see straight, which is debilitating I'm trying to align a grid of pixels around skincare copy and I can feel my skull collapsing around this vacuous abstraction I'm crafting with my eyeballs and fingers and cortex.</p>
<p>I bleed into a dissociated drift. My hormonal axes swollen to twitching oblivion, depth perception flattened into the buzzing tinnitus out the glaring windows.</p>
<p>The key is to leave immediately when you feel this even START to happen, otherwise you'll get caught shouting SHIT FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK SHIT down the stairwell and some placid man in an oxford who reminds you of your dad will raise his eyebrows at you and say nothing when you rasp a sweaty HEY at him, which is fair cause I probably look pretty bad.</p>
<p>Fake families with plastic hearts on NFL commericials- Semptember is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month; Buy some Bezos AI to keep your parents from getting too lonely while you keep the message on brand. But those days are over, now I eat metamucil everyday.</p>
<p>R2D2 at the bar looking at me like he knows something. I replay the day's social failures through my mind like SportsCenter. Gallons and gallons of top-shelf high-proof booze poured down smooth-talking throats trying ot accrue enough mass to feed their terrified/sedated children but I burn it all on booze and weed. A Toyota Tundra peaks at me from beneath the sandalwood blinds and suggests it's time to ride home slo-mo on my fuji-del-rey.</p>
<p>Duck into a motion activated matrix of stand/sit desks to retrieve my sweaty backpack. My movements have zeppelin-like bloat. Does anyone see this footage?</p>
