<p>it was the early 2000s so you could get on cable most hours and watch documentary footage of people smoking meth out of aluminum foil in their cars.</p>
<p>This is what we are doing and perhaps the tone deaf subject matter is why she inevitably goes for the water polo player and leaves me dropping out of band to eat cinnamon pita chips out behind the tennis club. Our romance remains an open question until she is hit by a freight train during her senior year at a liberal arts college in the midwest.</p>
<p>straight outta therapy and into the bar; I was so lonely at work today I wanted to cry. Trying to squeeze some emotions out of my constapated blood vessels while drowning in flourescent monitor glow, catching eyes for a second every few hours; these ecstatic sparks punctuating the endless drone of error messages and logs silently posting data into the ether around my head while I actively look at everything else.</p>
<p>I'm heavily dissociated when she passes my desk and whispers my name. She is pushing her highly designed office chair around with her feet and loudly talking shit on other women in the office. I try not to sweat on her and nod a lot.</p>
<p>We're all here just blinking at each other and I'm leaving with my clothes on, back to the BART where big men in various kinds of uniforms will spit and drool at me like starving cattle.</p>
<p>I am getting high in the shade with my sweater on and trying to clear my head of agnoizing visions of her next to cases of LaCroix. I was downwind of her moisturizer with a face like I'd gone incognito. She was blinking at me and talking about old movies as rush hour traffic visibly gathered outside the windows of the lunchroom, which was somehow empty except for the lady wiping down the counters who kept bouncing nervous glances off me like I was a school shooter.</p>
<p>I stumble out into the hissing sunshine from behind the overpass to shout FUCK at the sidewalk then retreat into a repurposed rubber factory and drink Hazy IPA/Vida Mezcal while surrounded by televisions displaying slow motion footage of cheesesteak/athletes. I am waiting on emails from Github or my mom. I wonder if my anxiety disorder is related to how she spent the pregnancy watching the first gulf war on CNN.</p> 
<p>I was already half-drunk when they caught me dripping my way home from the bar. I ran into him often and we usually made plans to hang out that never materialized, but this time was different but cause someone new was with him glowing darkly from behind a locally brewed sour and bumming hits off his Juul.</p>
<p>Blink-182 had come on Spotify at the bar and I finally did start to cry, but the battery died before the first chorus and everybody started cracking jokes before putting on more trap.</p>
<p>So now we're playing cornhole and I'm quickly getting too fucked up on the highly popular alcoholic water as the swollen hot night comes spinning in.</p>
<p>My ex had come by to pick up some things and when I get home I realize she's changed the garbage bag I'd been neglecting for like 2 weeks - it was a stab in the heart I remedied quickly with a bag of weed I'd just had delivered downstairs.</p>
<p>Only I don't have the finger nails or brain cells for the child lock so I go scrounging for my knife and see that she wrote a note saying she missed me on the front of my paycheck for the week.</p>
<p>We've been undergoing an amputation since the full moon in venus hit on my brother's birthday and I buttdialed her on the 22nd street overpass to tell her it was over. My shirt was off and the moon was orange and hot and giant and howling above the railyard like a gun pointed at my head.</p>
