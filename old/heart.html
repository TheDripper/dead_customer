<p>Thoughts of her swelling in me looking at the waxing moon and feeling it. I duck across work to drink in the corner writing blurry prose about her lavender phone case- her signature color I guess because it glows against her autumnal cascade of browns and blacks with tiny flashes of white above: these taking gentle flight as her soft gait across the room and I am blinded: she is mostly a dark blur. But her glasses pick up the flourescent blubs and leave ringing UV echoes in my vision against the morning hillside and dell monitors.</p>
