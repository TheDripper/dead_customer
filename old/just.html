<p>I wouldn't sit there and listen to a bunch of dudes drone about pussy so why do I tolerate the same re: dick?? It's the same high school bullshit obsessed with the thought of squiring at/on/in something-</p>
<p>Wondering if I forgot to put soap in the machine only I KNOW i did because I remember the sight of the pale blue silently slipping the hum of a room full of dryers so why do I smell so bad today?</p>
<p>Motherfucking football season and nobody can shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Spent about a week checking if I was gay but turns out I'm not. I kissed and held hands with a couple different boys but it didn't feel much different than hanging out with my friends. This made all the more obvious as soon as a woman walks into the room and in spinal/sacral refex without missing a beat I start doing/saying stupid shit to get her attention, sneaking glances and making my psychotic/sex face at empty bottles of IPA and burrito scraps.</p>
<p>Getting whiplash from trying not to look at her face. I see it and can't work for 4 hours, end up sweating myself into a stink and writhing muttered fucks in the white noise of my therapists waiting room.</p>
<p>Even catching her eyes for a fraction in the hallway holds a galaxy of electric charge compared to an entire evening out to drinks. He's a lovely man but I don't daydream about his body all over mine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile her face overs like Lakshmi or Eve or Barbie in my drunk tossing weed ripping insomnia hours, melting my sight into the ductwork against the shriek of state government highway contracts and hardscaping easement trucks backing up, backing up, backing up, apparently in an endless circle: all night, all night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Float in high on nasal decongestant and cold brew, trying to impress her with my casual posture and playful facial expressions.</li>
<li>She'd just come home to another drunk pothead spouting dharma at the wall.</li>
<li>What's the point?</li>
<li>Staring at my drink, starting to make myself cry by thinking too hard about John Mayer.</li>
</ul>
