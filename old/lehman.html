<p>It's the 10th anniversary of the Lehman Brothers Collapse and I am inhaling luxury cannabis vapor product over interstate 880, watching entire reams of 8-1/2" x 11" explode down the shoulder like flocks of nervous birds. </p>
<p>3 panels of Google Meet frown at me pensively from in between stock photography models.</p>
<p>have you ever received a religious omen from an episode of The X Files?</p>

<p>i am unable to do anything except sleep and smoke. i coalesce around open seating and hover like uncertain weather. my past lives mumble in dead angry languages over the recital of numbers and names on national public radio.</p>
<p>I am deaf to my own heartbeat, I am the unfeeling creep of fuel and concrete.</p> 
<p>Imagine: a hydraulic pallet of McGriddles loaded 8 x 4 x 10 and getting softly rained on thursday morning before work when a worried looking university girl throws open the door of her honda and takes you back to her newly completed dorm room building where she offers you some of her anxiety medication before you binge watch the first 3 seasons of The Office. You think of High School friends, this very moment perched in corporatized living facilities and twitching among bags of electric brain powder before descending into fast casual restaurants and feeling out slippery shapes against each others bodies.</p>
