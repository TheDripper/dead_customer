<p>When I was about 11 years old I had a dream that I was being drowned in a cylindrical tank before a live studio audience; they all cheered and clapped while I pounded on the glass for air. I don't remember how it ended.</p>
<p>Your gaze evaporates into an awkward offset as you turn to melt into the crowd across room and suddenly I'm alone in the parking lot at midnight.</p>
<p>All these words and none of it existed beyond the neural gossamer of my own eyes, always naked to your blinding sight.</p>
<p>Getting high in the shade again while families in indian summer outfits take the kids out to see the world. Imagine their struggle to survive in the crater left behind by this collapse: new wars, shortages, dreams of anything but raw blunt survival blinking out with the power failiure.</p>
<p>Yet in the meantime here we are: arranging casual sex on the internet and fawning over sneakers. And I'm apparently beginng to hatch my own domestic fantasy despite the possibility that the whole thing might burn down before middle school.</p>
<p>Smoothie food truck muzak wallpaper over the live set breakbeat kid that's always at the lake on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Put on a face of stoned indifference and tread lightly through the valley of spit and slurs to arise at the alcoholic neon beacon. Headlit fragments of 980 glide through twilight above the bar window with the dirty rise of a future now passed. I step outside for a piss and a cigarette while I can still keep my seat.</p>
<p>A man at the bar unintentionally eats his poke bowl to the beat. I knock over a pile of coasters as I shake his hand.</p>
