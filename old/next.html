<p>Feeling particularly bleak and ignoring work pings in the hot blind intersection waiting for the bar to open. I woke up after the beer-numb weekend on the bathroom floor in the dark with the shower running; regrouping against the hangover that was rapidly descending on my newly born consciousness.</p>
<p>My shrink advised me to have tea with myself which I'm kind of doing except with whiskey. Blank after 8 hours pounding internet into my face, alone in a room full of roving eyes- nauseated by this puppy dog trip on girls faces and hair or whatever; the harder I try to be something the further I dissolve.</p>
<p>I was gonna try to ride home before dark but Federer is pushing 5 sets and I'm watching with my parents via SMS so I get another old fashioned. I remember how she used to ask for my maraschino- we were regulars at a joint where the bartender would always give us extra just for her.</p>
<p>I'm wearing all black and my right pedal is loose but it can't be worse than the night I took the overpass half-blind off corner-store moscato.</p>
<p>I saw my dad for the first time in a while last weekend, he had the middle week of the US Open on mute in the living room while he studied pharma data and pondered what wood to use for shutters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier I was in the atrium with a pannini when I realized my drug habits have become obsolete.</li>
<li>A manzanita-skinned woman in prayer over the break point, both wrists draped with fine networks of gold; Federer is throwing his towel in disgust at the poor blue-eyed teenager who dives to catch it.</li>
<li>Men watching me sneak glances @ their girlfriends.</li>
<li>Pro american-footballer HOWIE LONG is selling chevys and sketchers at the same time.</li>
<li>Can I write about anything other than computers and women?</li>
</ul>
<p>Last time I was doing bong rips in my solo studio near the (original) Berkeley Bowl- she walked right in my front door and found me farting in the kitchen wearing christmas PJs. She said she wanted to lie down and having lied down platonically next to her countless times I thought nothing of it until she said the black and white candy cane dress she had on "was really just feeling restrictive and uncomfotable right now" this being the electric moment I realize her intentions at which point we proceed in a way I have yet to again achieve even after 10 years.</p>
<p>That was the only night we spent naked together.</p>
<p>What am I really waiting for? Legs? Hair and skin? Breath: a voice. Telling me who I am, hearing it come out of her ribcage like woodwinds.</p>
