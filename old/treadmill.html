<p>When I was 21 I dreamt I was in my parents' garage searching through bloated ziplock bags full of orange popsicle prescription bottles for klonopin and adderall. I woke up disappointed, clutching my stuttering gut.</p>
<p>Retreat to the low erotic hum of the bathroom because it's where you go to masturbate or do drugs in secret while your family eats christmas dinner.</p>
<p>Prosecco at work lunch feeling fancy as shit with my ahi salad, talking about babies and putting it on the card.</p>
<p>Painting all these fantasies on her dark smoky face- all I can think about is her face, no other body parts, except also those colofrul shirt/dress/tunic things she wears over her jeans.</p>
<p>Until then washing it off with another caustic bloated layer of scotch and mezcal. Trying to keep my handwriting under control and get it all in before dark cause I still don't have lights on my bike.</p>
<p>Her her her. I know nothing about her.</p>
<p>I should throw this fucking phone out the window: it is a wellspring of emotional distress. I wince every time it pings because I know the one I really want to talk to right now doesn't have my number.</p>
