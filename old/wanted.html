<p>Dirt cheap outside on the floor at Eli's, I order another drink and slump by the garbage can to write because I'm done following quasi-strangers around like a fucking puppy.</p>
<p>A sea of irrelevant laughter, I recite your face in my third eye like a prayer. I will ride home and howl your name at the Motel 6 in the roaring dark with no hands.</p>
<p>I have been riding my bike through the utter black, waiting for a voice. My ex's name was light but I'm blind now: I need sound, chords.</p>
<p>Today I walked from Jack London to the UC campus remembering different friends and lovers as I passed through the neighborhoods where we used to hangout until I ended up by the creek behind the tower where I used to pack bowls between art class with art girls and feeling so bright and open- eventually giving up on class but not on weed so coming back here years later to look at braids of fabric and corningware pots full of crayons left behind.</p>
<p>I walked past so many bars and cafes today full of people who do not know me to end up here alone with a raging mosaic of my past loves and the setting sun.</p>
