<p>An attractive woman approaching 30 with a Latina or maybe middle eastern complexion and big cat eye makeup.</p>
    <p>She looks almost childlike the way she is staring out the shotgun window of the black Lexus SUV driven by her male companion and presumably romantic partner who is literally a two dimensional shadow seated at her left, out of eyeshot. There is nothing wanting or fearful in her gaze: she is just taking in the aquatic passing of trees and curbs with soft delight the way kids do when they’re tired and being driven home from somewhere fun.</p>
    <p>This is her face when her eyes meet mine. I am standing on the corner in sweatpants with a stomach ache. I am thinking about laundry and then her face: dreamlike and floating in luxury glass. There is a reaction in her eyes but I am completely unable to discern the flavor of it: her face remains warm and vacant. They are idling at the red light and we are staring at each other. The shadow is totally oblivious. I look at his face and see only products.</p>
    <p>I look back and she is still staring. A full on smile has crept up one side of her face, sly and bordering on sinister. I’m pretty high so the longer I look the more she starts to seem like bad news.</p>
    <p>Suddenly she vomits all over the dashboard with incredible violence. Heaving lurches of terrible wet mass running down the dashboard on onto what look like shopping bags by her feet.</p>
    <p>I take a half-step back in reflex but continue staring, involuntarily. Shadow man has removed his Gucci sunglasses and he's looking at her not with concern but disgust, maybe outrage, like he thought she was a human female but now here she is revealed actually to be some kind of diseased mutant freak, in his car. We both stare at her in silence for a number of seconds, the world totally motionless except for her explosive writhing.</p>
    <p>Then shadow man looks up and catches me spectating. He looks indignant as he makes right and turns the corner in a chirpy huff. I shake my head and keep walking back to my apartment, wondering out loud if she was smiling because she knew she was gonna puke- if she had done it on purpose…</p>
    <p>Another dead customer spitting burnt slang to the girls on slack while the CEO makes cheerful references to the Netflix favor of the month.</p>
